#### Provide human-readable docs

Provide human-readable documentation that client developers can use to
understand your API.

If you create a schema with prmd as described above, you can easily
generate Markdown docs for all endpoints with `prmd doc`.

In addition to endpoint details, provide an API overview with
information about:

* Authentication, including acquiring and using authentication tokens.
* API stability and versioning, including how to select the desired API
  version.
* Common request and response headers.
* Error serialization format.
* Examples of using the API with clients in different languages.
