OpenResty is a full-fledged web platform by integrating the standard [Nginx](nginx.html) core,
[LuaJIT](luajit.html), many carefully written Lua libraries, lots of high quality
[3rd-party Nginx modules](components.html), and most of their external dependencies.
It is designed to help developers easily build scalable web applications, web
services, and dynamic web gateways.

By taking advantage of various well-designed [Nginx](nginx.html) modules (most
of which are developed by the OpenResty team themselves), OpenResty effectively
turns the nginx server into a powerful web app server, in which the web developers
can use the Lua programming language to script various existing nginx C modules
and Lua modules and construct extremely high-performance web applications that
are capable to handle 10K ~ 1000K+ connections in a single box.

OpenResty aims to run your server-side web app completely in the [Nginx](nginx.html) server,
leveraging [Nginx](nginx.html)'s event model to do non-blocking I/O not only
with the HTTP clients, but also with remote backends like MySQL, PostgreSQL,
Memcached, and Redis.

Real-world applications of OpenResty range from dynamic web portals and web
gateways, web application firewalls, web service platforms for mobile
apps/advertising/distributed storage/data analytics,
to full-fledged dynamic web applications and web sites. The hardware used to
run OpenResty also ranges from very big metals to embedded devices with very
limited resources. It is not uncommon for our production users to serve billions
of requests daily for millions of active users with just a handful of machines.

OpenResty is *not* an [Nginx](nginx.html) fork. It is just a software bundle.
Most of the patches applied to the [Nginx](nginx.html) core in OpenResty have
already been submitted to the official [Nginx](nginx.html) team and most of
the patches submitted have also been accepted. We are trying hard *not* to fork
[Nginx](nginx.html) and always to use the latest best [Nginx](nginx.html) core
from the official [Nginx](nginx.html) team.

See [Components](components.html) for the complete list of software bundled
in OpenResty.

See [GettingStarted](getting-started.html) on how to quickly setup an OpenResty
server that can say hello world over HTTP. Or you can go to the [Download](download.html) section
to grab OpenResty's source code tarball directly.

We provide free technical support in the openresty and openresty-en mailing
lists. See [Community](community.html).
