This module wraps lots of [Nginx](nginx.html) internal APIs for streaming input
and output, parallel/sequential subrequests, timers and sleeping, as well as
various meta data accessing.

Basically it provides various utilities that help testing and debugging of other
modules by trivially emulating different kinds of faked subrequest locations.
