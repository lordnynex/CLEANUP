This bundle is mainly maintained by Yichun Zhang ([agentzh](http://agentzh.org)).
It was originally sponsored by [Taobao.com](http://www.taobao.com) before the
year 2011 and it has been mainly supported by [CloudFlare](http://www.cloudflare.com) since
then.

Because most of the [Nginx](nginx.html) modules are developed by the bundle
maintainers, it can be ensured
that all these modules are played well together.

The bundled software components are copyrighted by the respective copyright
holders.  Basically only components with BSD style licenses are included. If
you find exceptions, please let me know.

This web site is a dynamic web application built completely upon the OpenResty
platform and the PostgreSQL database. The whole application is
opensourced on [GitHub](github.html):

Feel free to fork it or just [contact us](contact-us.html) to obtain a git commit
bit if you want to edit and improve this site.
