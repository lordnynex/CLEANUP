For large grants to the [OpenResty](openresty.html) Software Foundation, please
contact `donate@openresty.org` via emails.


#  Donate With PayPal

If you'd like to make a one-time small donation to [OpenResty](openresty.html),
you can use PayPal to make it fast and easy.

* PayPal members can donate directly from their PayPal accounts by logging in
via the PayPal website and clicking "send money" to `agentzh@gmail.com`, or
just click the button below.
* Non-PayPal members can still pay with a credit card without signing up for
PayPal. Click the button below then follow the instructions at the bottom of
the page for non-PayPal members.

#  Donate with AliPay (支付宝)

If you're in China, it's usually more convenient to send donation is to send
money via the [AliPay](http://www.alipay.com/) to my account `yichun0511@gmail.com` or
just scan the following QR code in your AliPay cellphone app:
