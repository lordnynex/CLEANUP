The IETF standard IPFIX (IP Flow Information eXport) defines the formats and procedures for handling these flows. Furthermore, the Netflow.v9 and the PSAMP (Packet Sampling) standards are supported. Vermont runs on Linux and derivatives of BSD. It can receive and process raw packets via PCAP (up to 1 GBit/s) as well as IPFIX/Netflow.v9 flow data.
