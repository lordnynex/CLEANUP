Version 1.2.1
=============
 * Fixed members registration not working with pointers and shared pointers to objects
 * Enforced const-correctness: a pointer or a shared pointer to a const object will now only have access to reading members and calling const functions

Version 1.2
=============
Major:
 * Added support for metatables
 * Fixed bug with ref and const-ref callback parameters
 * Fixed exceptions not being thrown by writeVariable with Lua 5.2
 * Fixed exception-safety when callbacks throw exceptions

Minor:
 * Changed LuaEmptyArray to LuaContext::EmptyArray and LuaMetatable to LuaContext::Metatable (former definitions are working but deprecated)
 * Fixed custom object being copied instead of moved when being returned by a callback
 * Fixed bug when reading arrays from boost::variant

Version 1.1
=============
Major:
 * Functions with a varying number of parameters are now supported
 * Removed VariableDoesntExistException (this class was a remainder from the old version and was never thrown by anything)
 * Attempting to call a function with the wrong parameter types now triggers a Lua error instead of an exception
 * Now possible to write and read enums

Minor:
 * Added reading LuaFunctionCaller as a faster alternative to reading functions
 * Fixed writing std::vector producing arrays starting at offset 0
 * Registered functions are now stored inside the Lua state instead of maps in LuaContext
 * Added more assertions and more static assertions
 * Fixed exception safety when writing inside tables
 * Now using Boost type_traits instead of standard library type_traits
 * Writing a function or function object with a trivial destructor now writes a C closure instead of a userdata with metatable
