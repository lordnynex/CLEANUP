Find PGP keys with formats/packets I have never seen before
Make error handling more reasonable? (currently everything throws exceptions)
add encrypt/decrypt with passphrase
encrypt+sign stuff
deal with partial packets properly
finish sign functions
find packets properly (check if uid is associated with key, etc)
use Parameter Objects to reduce argument count for functions
encrypt for multiple recipients
sign with multiple keys
