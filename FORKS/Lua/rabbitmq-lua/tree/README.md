# RabbitMQ LuaJIT bindings and helper functions

## Introduction

This is a RabbitMQ client binding to LuaJIT. It allows Lua scripts act as AMQP clients
to the Broker. It requires the RabbitMQ C library (https://github.com/alanxz/rabbitmq-c). 


Warning: This is a very early release of rather naive LuaJIT code.
It is currently able to run the included test scripts.

Proper documenation and module cleanup is forthcoming.

## Building

You'll need LuaJIT and a fairly recent version of the RabbitMQ C library for this to work.
