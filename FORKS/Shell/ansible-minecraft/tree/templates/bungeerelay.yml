# Welcome to the BungeeRelay configuration file.
# These small comments serve as an explanation of what each value is and general guidance.

# Please remember the following before you begin:
# - This plugin is not a standalone IRCd, and will not function without an InspIRCd
#   instance to link to. You can find InspIRCd at http://inspircd.org/
# - This plugin is currently only compatible with recent versions of InspIRCd. This is
#   the only type of IRCd you should use with this plugin, NOT UnrealIRCd etc.
# - Make sure you enable m_spanningtree.so in modules.conf.

# If you need any help, post on the discussion thread or poke me (Dead-i) on IRC.

# This section mainly uses info from your link block, in links.conf.
