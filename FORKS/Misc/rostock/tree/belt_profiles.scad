	Belt profile library in my fondest dreams would encapsulate profile data for all of the popular timing belt
	profiles that people like to use for their robotics projects. Please contribute your tested profiles!
	
	definitions:
		p = pitch; "The distance between successive corresponding points or lines, e.g., between the teeth of a cogwheel"
		hs = total belt height from belt back to tooth tip
		ht = total height of tooth from belt root line to tooth tip
		s = tooth root width; distance between root radii centers
		g = tooth flank angle; if tooth flanks were extended until they intercepted, this is the angle they'd make
		ra = tooth tip radius connecting tooth flank to tooth tip
		rr = tooth root radius connecting tooth flank to belt root line
		w_scale = tooth width scale. Increase or decrease to improve tooth fit
		h_scale = tooth height scale. Increase or decrease to improve tooth fit
