# CLEANUP

I have this really annoying habit of forking repositories I like or want to experiment with instead of simply staring them. After awhile I end up with repositories everywhere and it's bugged me for long enough.

## Why?

Several years ago I made the mistake of writing some code that depended on someones experimental library. All worked well until the next day I went to work and attempted to pickup where I left off and the owner of this lib's repo deleted it because he believed it was 'bad work'. For convoluted reasons, I did not have a copy of the lib anymore. Even if I had a copy of it somewhere, it made me realize the ephemeral nature of peoples personal projects. Something they see as a temporary experiment with a short shelf life can sometimes serve as inspiration or reference for unrelated projects for years to come. I use these forks almost daily. They serve as architectural inspiration, points of reference, or simply a way for me to freeze something in time.

My hope is is that I will be able to use these things more effectively. I have a tendency sometimes to recall I have a fork that solves a similar problem, but absolutely can not remember which fork it was. At least now they'll be consolidated and I can use code searching tools to help.
